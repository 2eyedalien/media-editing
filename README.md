# Media Editing Practice

A clean starter repo to showcase media-editing practice. Uploaded notebooks were sanitized to:
- remove hard-coded **file names/paths** (replaced with generic placeholders like `path/to/image.png`),
- strip **testing / debug lines** (e.g., `print(...)`, `plt.show()`, `cv2.imshow(...)`, `__main__` demo blocks),
- clear outputs and execution counts for a tidy commit.

## Structure

```
media-editing-practice/
├── notebooks/
│   └── - Pixelsediting1_CLEAN.ipynb
- Untitled13_CLEAN.ipynb
├── src/
│   └── utils.py
├── data/                 # empty, place your own inputs here
├── requirements.txt
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

## Usage

- Put your own input files under `data/`.
- Open the cleaned notebooks in `notebooks/` and replace placeholder paths with real ones on your machine.
- Keep outputs cleared before committing to keep the repo lightweight.
